Editing pages in Github is **super simple**, just click on the pencil in the top right corner and open an editing interface where you can even preview the changes that you are applying. Once you are done add a short comment to your change (_commit_ in git/github vocabulary) and save them. Remember all changes are saved and available for you to explore afterwards if needed.
