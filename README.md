# gh-pages-minima-starter

This is a template and some instructions for running Github Pages with the [`minima` theme][minima]. This repo has what I consider the minimum pieces for a personal blog using [Jekyll][jk] and [Github Pages][gh-site]:

* Frontpage that includes your last blog posts: `_pages/frontpage.md`
* Archive for all your posts: `_pages/archive.md`
* About page: `_pages/about.md`
* Minimum 404 page: `_pages/404.md`
* Minimum metadata in the `_config.yml`
* Example CSS change inside `assets/main.scss`
* Custom footer template `_includes/footer.html`

Check out the excellent [`minima` theme][minima] documentation for further details and customization and the [official docs][gh] for more details on how Github Pages work.

For more details on how to set it up locally, create content, use Github interface, etc. feel free to visit this [website post][dev] or the source code here.

Do you have questions? feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/jsanz/gh-pages-minima-starter/issues/new/choose) or [contact me](https://jorgesanz.net/contact).

Enjoy!!
